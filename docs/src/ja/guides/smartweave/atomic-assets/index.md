# Atomic Assets

An atomic asset is a unique package that includes data, labels (also known as tags), and a specific agreement, all under a single, unchangeable identifier. This allows applications and users to access the data, labels, and agreement by using just this one identifier.

To enable trading of the Atomic Asset, we must connect it to something called a SmartWeave Token. This connection transforms the asset into what's known as an Atomic Token and allows it to be exchanged or traded.

The SmartWeave Token has a special feature called a balances object that keeps track of who owns the tokens related to that particular asset. This ensures that ownership and trades are recorded and managed accurately.

## Deploying Atomic Assets
